## Internet of Things Endpoint

### Code Explaination
This IoT project, implemented on an Arduino Mega microcontroller, focuses on monitoring and controlling environmental conditions. The code is designed to interface with various sensors to collect temperature and humidity data, making it suitable for applications like smart climate control or environmental monitoring.

### Key Features:
- **Sensor Integration:** The code incorporates sensors such as the DHT22 for temperature and humidity measurements.
- **Data Acquisition:** It regularly reads sensor data, providing real-time feedback on environmental conditions.
- **Data Logging:** The project includes a feature to log collected data to an SD card, facilitating long-term data storage.
- **Remote Access:** It enables remote access to sensor data via Wi-Fi or Ethernet connections, making it accessible from anywhere.
- **Alert System:** The code can trigger alerts or notifications based on predefined thresholds, ensuring proactive responses to environmental changes.

This code serves as a foundation for building IoT solutions that require real-time monitoring and control of environmental parameters. It can be customized and extended to suit specific use cases, offering a versatile platform for IoT development.

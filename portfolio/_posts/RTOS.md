## Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) Scheduler

### Code Explanation
This C++ program serves as an example of a basic RTOS scheduler designed for embedded systems.
It demonstrates essential concepts of embedded programming, emphasizing object-oriented
design and efficient task scheduling.

### Features
- Task Management: The scheduler manages multiple tasks with varying priorities.
- Priority-Based Execution: Tasks are executed in order of priority, ensuring critical tasks 
    take precedence.
- Object-Oriented Approach: Utilizes object-oriented programming principles for modularity 
    and maintainability.
- Customizable: This is a foundational example that can be extended and tailored to meet the 
    specific real-time requirements of embedded systems.

### Usage
This code provides a starting point for building a more comprehensive RTOS scheduler suitable
for diverse embedded system applications. Developers can customize and expand upon this 
foundation to meet project-specific needs.

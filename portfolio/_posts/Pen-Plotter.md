## DIY Pen Plotter

I recently built a Pen Plotter from scratch using an Arduino Uno and an array of creative engineering solutions. I love to innovate and repurpose materials, and this project does just that! The resulting plotter is a tangible fusion of art and technology.

Checkout my Instagram for seeing it in action:

### Arduino Uno at the Core 
This project centers around an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the project's central processing unit. I programmed it to execute precise movements and instructions for creating hand-drawn artworks.

### NEMA-17 Stepper Motors
Achieving precision in pen movements was essential. To this end, I integrated NEMA-17 stepper motors known for their accuracy. They were crucial for transforming digital designs into real-world sketches.

### CNC Shield Integration 
A CNC shield acted as the liaison between the Arduino and the stepper motors, facilitating seamless communication and control.

### Resourceful 3D Printing 
I 3D-printed custom components, brackets, and mounts. These pieces ensured perfect alignment of the pen and paper. 3D-Printing is essential for repurposing materials.

### GRBL-Based Control
I used of GRBL firmware for G-Code commands and interpretation.

### Embedded C: 
I designed and implemented embedded-C programs responsible for converting SVG files—common vector graphic formats—into G-code instructions. 

My completed DIY Pen Plotter encapsulates my passion for merging art and technology and highlights my ability to transform innovative concepts into tangible reality. As a unique addition to my resume and portfolio, this project underlines my dedication to the intersection of art, technology, and resourcefulness, showcasing my capacity to transform imaginative ideas into remarkable creations, one stroke at a time.
